1). Technologies Used:
In this project, I used Javascript JQuery.  I used the slick to create the carousel.  I used fontAwesome and Google Fonts to style.



2). Your Process / Approach:
I decided to create my About me page in sections starting with an image slide of what I like to do.  Followed with a short descrition of myself, projects that I already worked on at GA and contact information.
I added a scrollTop script to my nav links so that a certain section will scroll up.  Tried to use animate with a time.
I added a lightbox script and carousel script to the portofolio section.
I added Media Query to make the site responsive.



3). Unsolved Problems:
			a).  I used a jquery scrollTop script with animation to add time interval for my navigation bar to link to scroll a certain section on my page to the top.
			The good news is that the function worked, but the bad news is that the sections do not align with the fixed navigation bar.

			b). My next problem was my contact form.  I still am not able to get it send anywhere.  I need to work on that.

			c.  The next problem is the lightbox script.  I wasn't able to figure out the correct function to have the image pop up on the portfolio section.

4). Your biggest Wins and Challenges:
My biggest win is that I actually created my very first personal "About Me" Responsive Website.  I was able to get online with GitHub Pages.

This was very challenging for me. (Partly, because this was only my 3rd week learning HTML, CSS and JS).  I'm finally getting HTML/CSS styling and where to get resources. I'm still challenged with Javascript/JQuery and functions.
